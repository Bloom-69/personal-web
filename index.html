                        I made this bot for fun while I was bored, so I've decided to use

                    </p>

                        This website was mostly made with html and css. Instead of using a web framework (or something
                        osbcure you aren't supposed to do), I decided to make lightweight as possible.

                        forked from Solenoid before my sister made Dumling disappear out of thin air. (I think it's a

                        A material 3 styled blog (and yes, it was bit misleading, no wonder I messed up the search
                        thingy), used to post here... Sort of, bit rarely due my mind realize my blog doesn't exist.

                        Another <code>Solid.js</code> revolt client. But it's <i>verrrry</i> rushed as hell (and it's
                        very buggy and slow as f*ck). But unforunately, it was discontinued due how unmaintainable the
                        client was (yes, it was made extacly <b>12 hours non-stop</b>, please forgive me what I have
                        done).
