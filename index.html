                        I made this bot for fun while I was bored, so I've decided to use
                        <code>revolt.js@7.0.0_beta.11</code> (sorry, no discord version)
                    </p>
                    <p>This bot is just self explanatory, since he was able to talk if where a person talking in your
                        server. Also it does use Gemini API by Google</p>

                        This website was mostly made with html and css. Instead of using a web framework (or something
                        osbcure you aren't supposed to do), I decided to make lightweight as possible.

                        A <code>Solid.js</code> revolt client that has <i>some features</i> (most are missing). It's was
                        forked from Solenoid before my sister made Dumling disappear out of thin air. (I think it's a
                        lore????)

                        A material 3 styled blog (and yes, it was bit misleading, no wonder I messed up the search
                        thingy), used to post here... Sort of, bit rarely due my mind realize my blog doesn't exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>It was created with Astro, if you didn't know.</p>

                        Another <code>Solid.js</code> revolt client. But it's <i>verrrry</i> rushed as hell (and it's very buggy and slow as f*ck). But unforunately, it was discontinued due how unmaintainable the client was (yes, it was made extacly <b>12 hours non-stop</b>, please forgive me what I have done).
